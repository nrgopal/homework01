# FINAL

The final project consists of building a REST API frontend to a time series database that allows for basic CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete - operations and also allows users to submit an analysis job of building a graph from the dataset.

This project is based on the dataset Austin Code COVID-19 Cases. 
The dataset can be found here: https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/Austin-Code-COVID-19-Complaint-Cases-Dashboard/5bvq-24pm

This dataset displays information on COVID-19 complaints which Austin Code has received since March 17th, 2020. This dataset is unique to Austin Code case responses and doesn't include case data from Austin Fire, Austin Police, or other entities responding to COVID-19 complaints.

Each entry in the dataset represents an individual complaint.

The project includes two separate pieces of documentation: 
- DEPLOYMENT.md provides instructions for deploying the system
- DEVELOPER.md is geared towards users/developers who interact with the system
