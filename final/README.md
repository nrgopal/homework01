# FINAL
This final project works with Austin COVID-19 Complaints from the past 6 months.
The final project consists of building a REST API frontend to a time series database that allows for basic CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete - operations and also allows users to submit an analysis job of building a graph from the dataset.

The project includes two separate pieces of documentation: 
- DEPLOYMENT.md provides instructions for deploying the system
- DEVELOPER.md is geared towards users/developers who interact with the system
